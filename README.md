## Important message

This game is very unfinished, however it lays decent groundwork moving foreward.

The enemies after dying were suppose to disappear, however I was unable to find a completely transparent texture.

Beware of bugs and other techical issues.

Ignore the 'dump' folder, it's a placeholder for temporary files/ideas.

## Controls

'W' - jump

'A' - move left

'D' - move right

'S' - attack

'SPACE' - roll
